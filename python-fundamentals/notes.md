### Variables 
- A variable is assigned using equal sign. 
- It follows snake_case like for eg. `max_retries`. 
- Must start with letter or underscore(_). 
- It uses dynamic typing which means we dont need to explicityl declare variable type.
- Can contain letters , numbers and underscores.


### Comments
- We can use comments or docstrings to explain the intent ,rationale and usage of a code
- Can u `#` for a single comment and for mutiple comments prefix each line with the same symbol
- We can also sorround the code with `'''` or `"""` quotes for multiline/block comments. But one point to note here , it will be considered as docstrings/docs
